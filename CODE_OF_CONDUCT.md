# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We want **The Sign Age** to be a welcoming, inclusive place to learn, build, and collaborate.

That means:

- Treat people with respect
- Assume good intent, especially in text-only communication
- Prefer constructive feedback over “gotchas”
- Keep discussions focused on the work and the ideas

If you’re not sure whether something is okay, err on the side of kindness. (A good rule of thumb: would you want this comment displayed on a lobby screen for a week?)

## Expected behavior

Examples of behavior that helps this project:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what’s best for the project

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Personal attacks or demeaning comments
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Disruptive behavior in issues, pull requests, or discussions

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, and other community channels).

## Reporting and enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Please report it by opening a confidential report via GitHub if available, or by contacting the repository maintainers.
- If the report is about a security issue, follow the process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

Maintainers will review reports and take action they deem appropriate to keep the community safe and constructive.

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by common open source community standards, adapted for this project.

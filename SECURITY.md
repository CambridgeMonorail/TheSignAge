# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is in active development. Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Preferred reporting method:

1. Use GitHub Security Advisories: go to the repository page → **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.

If the Security tab/reporting workflow isn’t available for some reason:

- Contact the maintainers privately (for example via a GitHub direct message).

## What to include

To help us reproduce and fix the issue quickly:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (or a minimal proof-of-concept)
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Affected areas (files, routes, packages, configurations)

## Coordinated disclosure

We appreciate coordinated disclosure. We’ll aim to acknowledge your report promptly and work with you on a reasonable timeline for a fix.

Thanks for helping keep The Sign Age safe — unattended screens deserve unattended security.

# Implementation Plan: Signage Showcase Demo Site

**Created:** 2026-02-07  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Related:** [shadcnui-signage Library](./2026-02-07-shadcnui-signage-library.md)

## Goal

Transform the `apps/client` demo site from a generic SPA boilerplate showcase into a digital signage showcase that demonstrates the capabilities of The Sign Age project. The site should present a landing page that explains the project purpose, followed by a directory/gallery of full-screen signage examples that users can navigate to experience what digital signage content looks like.

## Context

### Current State

- **apps/client** currently showcases generic SPA features from the original template
- Landing page describes "The Boilerplate That Speeds Up SPA Development"
- Navigation includes: Landing, Dashboard, About, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Contact, Blog, Terms, StatusBoard, Library, Color Palette
- Current content does not reflect The Sign Age's digital signage purpose
- Project README.md clearly states: "Digital signage as a software platform"
- `@tsa/shadcnui-signage` library has been created with ScreenFrame, SplitScreen, FullscreenHero, InfoCardGrid components

### Why This Work

The demo site is the first impression for anyone visiting the project. Currently it:

- ❌ Misrepresents the project as a "boilerplate that speeds up SPA development"
- ❌ Shows generic web app pages that don't demonstrate signage concepts
- ❌ Doesn't showcase the signage-specific components in `@tsa/shadcnui-signage`
- ❌ Misses opportunity to demonstrate distance-readable typography, fixed-aspect layouts, and deterministic rendering

The demo should:

- ✅ Clearly communicate the project's digital signage focus
- ✅ Provide interactive examples of signage screens
- ✅ Demonstrate the signage components in realistic contexts
- ✅ Be visually compelling and appropriate for the use case

### User Experience Flow

```
[Landing Page]
     |
     | User clicks "View Examples" or "Explore Gallery"
     v
[Gallery/Directory Page]
     |
     | User clicks on signage example tile
     v
[Full-Screen Signage Example]
     |
     | User uses browser back button
     v
[Gallery/Directory Page]
```

## Architecture Decisions

### URL Structure

```
/                          → Landing page (explains project)
/gallery                   → Directory of signage examples
/signage/welcome           → Example: Welcome screen
/signage/menu              → Example: Restaurant menu
/signage/wayfinding        → Example: Office directory/wayfinding
/signage/dashboard         → Example: KPI dashboard
/signage/announcements     → Example: Announcements board
/signage/event-schedule    → Example: Event schedule
```

### Layout Strategy

**Landing page:** Uses existing `@tsa/landing` components with updated content

**Gallery page:** Custom grid layout with preview cards, uses Layout component with sidebar for navigation

**Signage examples:** Full-screen (no Layout/sidebar), uses `@tsa/shadcnui-signage` components directly

### Component Reuse

- **Landing:** Reuse HeroSection, FeaturesSection, CTASection, Footer from `@tsa/landing`
- **Gallery:** Custom component using Card from `@tsa/shadcnui`
- **Signage examples:** Use ScreenFrame, SplitScreen, FullscreenHero, InfoCardGrid from `@tsa/shadcnui-signage`

### Navigation Pattern

**Landing → Gallery:** Explicit navigation button/link

**Gallery → Signage:** Click on example card

**Signage → Gallery:** Browser back button (no chrome/navigation in signage view)

**Alternative navigation:** Could add a small "Back to Gallery" button in top corner of signage examples (optional)

## Expected Results

### Before

- Landing page describes "boilerplate that speeds up SPA development"
- Demo site shows generic web app pages (Dashboard, About, Pricing, etc.)
- No demonstration of digital signage concepts
- Misaligned with project purpose

### After

- Landing page clearly communicates digital signage focus
- Gallery page provides directory of signage examples
- Multiple full-screen signage examples using `@tsa/shadcnui-signage` components
- Demonstrates distance-readable typography, fixed-aspect layouts, deterministic rendering
- Clean navigation focused on signage showcase
- Aligned with project purpose as stated in README.md

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Landing page accurately represents The Sign Age project
- [ ] Gallery page displays at least 4-6 signage examples
- [ ] Each signage example uses components from `@tsa/shadcnui-signage`
- [ ] Signage examples render full-screen without Layout
- [ ] Browser back button works correctly
- [ ] No references to "boilerplate" or generic SPA concepts
- [ ] `pnpm verify` passes
- [ ] Demo site provides clear value to visitors understanding the project

## Open Questions

1. **Branding/imagery:** Do we need custom images/graphics for landing page hero? Or use simple gradients?
2. **Back button in signage examples:** Should we add a small "Back to Gallery" button, or rely solely on browser back button?
3. **Signage example content:** Should we use realistic placeholder content (e.g., actual restaurant menu items) or keep it generic/abstract?
4. **Animation/transitions:** Should signage examples have any transitions or animations (slide-in, fade-in) to demonstrate time-based content?
5. **Gallery organization:** Should examples be organized by category (Welcome, Wayfinding, Dashboards, etc.) or presented as flat list?

## Notes

- This work depends on `@tsa/shadcnui-signage` components being functional (ScreenFrame, SplitScreen, FullscreenHero, InfoCardGrid)
- If signage components are not ready, Phase 3 can use placeholder implementations with TODO comments
- Consider adding a "Work in Progress" badge to signage examples that are not fully polished
- Gallery page could be enhanced later with filtering, search, aspect ratio toggle
- Signage examples could be enhanced later with live data integration, real-time updates, interactive elements

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1:** 2-3 hours (landing page content update)
- **Phase 2:** 3-4 hours (gallery page creation)
- **Phase 3:** 6-8 hours (signage examples, varies by complexity)
- **Phase 4:** 1-2 hours (cleanup old pages)
- **Phase 5:** 2-3 hours (testing and polish)

**Total:** 14-20 hours

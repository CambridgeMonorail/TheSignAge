# Statement of Intent

The Sign Age is an exploration of digital signage as software.

This repository exists to document, prototype, and share practical work around building bespoke, generative, and data-driven content for digital signage players, with a particular focus on BrightSign devices, from the perspective of experienced frontend developers.

Digital signage is often treated as a solved problem. Templates, slide decks, CMS tools, and marketing abstractions dominate the space. That approach works for some use cases, but it leaves a large amount of creative and technical potential unexplored.

This project starts from a different assumption.

Signage screens are computers bolted to walls.
They run continuously.
They operate offline.
They exist in physical space.
They have time, state, failure modes, and constraints.

Those characteristics make them interesting.

The intent of this repository is to:

- Treat signage players as programmable systems, not presentation tools
- Translate signage concepts into mental models familiar to web and frontend engineers
- Explore what is possible when modern web technologies meet always-on, unattended hardware
- Be honest about constraints, quirks, trade-offs, and failure cases
- Share real experiments, not polished marketing narratives

This is not a CMS.
This is not a tutorial series for beginners.
This is not official BrightSign documentation.

It is a working notebook for people who already know how to build software and want to apply that skill to screens that live on walls, in shops, stations, offices, and public spaces.

The accompanying YouTube channel exists as an extension of this repository. Videos are treated as executable explanations. Code, ideas, and decisions should stand on their own here, regardless of the medium they are later presented in.

If something here feels unfinished, opinionated, or slightly uncomfortable, that is intentional. The goal is to surface the edges of the platform, not to smooth them away.

Signage is software.
It deserves to be treated as such.

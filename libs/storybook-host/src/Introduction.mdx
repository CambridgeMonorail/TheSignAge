# Welcome to The Sign Age Component Library

## Overview

The Sign Age is a **working notebook for building digital signage software**. This Storybook documents our signage-focused component library built with React 19, Tailwind v4, and organized in an Nx monorepo.

**Digital signage is our primary focus.** Everything in this library is designed around the constraints and requirements of always-on, distance-readable displays for BrightSign devices and similar hardware.

## What Makes Signage Different?

Digital signage has unique requirements compared to standard web applications:

- **Distance Readability**: Content must be legible from 10+ feet away (the "10-foot rule")
- **Fixed Aspect Ratios**: Layouts must be deterministic for known screen resolutions (1920x1080, 3840x2160, etc.)
- **24/7 Operation**: Components must handle always-on, unattended operation
- **Predictable Rendering**: No dynamic reflows or unpredictable layouts
- **Performance**: Smooth animations and transitions even on embedded hardware

## Library Structure

Our components are organized by purpose:

### 1. Signage Components (`@tsa/shadcnui-signage`)

**This is our primary focus.** Signage-specific components built for distance readability and deterministic layouts.

- **Primitives**: Core building blocks (ScreenFrame, SignageContainer, etc.)
- **Layouts**: Fixed-aspect layout patterns (SplitScreen, etc.)
- **Blocks**: Composed signage components (MetricCard, EventCard, FullscreenHero, etc.)

### 2. Supporting Libraries

These libraries support the demo website and provide building blocks for signage components:

- **@tsa/shadcnui**: Our copy of shadcn/ui components, organized for monorepo reuse
- **@tsa/shadcnui-blocks**: Composite components for general web use
- **@tsa/landing**: Landing page sections for the demo website
- **@tsa/shell**: Application shell components (layouts, navigation)

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** - Latest stable with improved rendering
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - CSS-first configuration
- **Nx 22** - Monorepo management
- **Vite 7** - Fast build tool
- **TypeScript 5.9** - Strict type checking

## Getting Started

Explore the **Signage** section first to see our primary components. Then browse the supporting libraries to understand the building blocks we use.
